##Smart contract interaction

_Simple way to interact with contract. In this case Aave_

Run the command below to coppy the repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/21fahm/Aave.git
```

You can use npm or yarn to do package installation.

```shell
npm i
or
yarn add
```

Use npx when interacting with hardhat. If you choose to use hardhat.

```shell
npx hardhat deploy
npx hardhat run scripts/<name of script>
npx hardhat node
```

Need to add uniswap to ensure that contract repays the entire loan.
Otherwise it works great.😁
